Hello,

My name is Timothy and I am working on becoming getting into the data field.  I have been busy learning various tools and technologies such as SQL, Python, R, QGIS, and Power BI.  I am also currently working on a certificate in Data Analytics from the Community College of Allegheny County and eventually plan to pursue a Master's degree in a data or math related field of study.

When I am not working on professional development I like to develop myself personally by spending my time reading, listening to podcasts, being active outside in nature, doing yoga or training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
